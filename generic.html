								<p>The manager of a bank wants to know what job has the highest total balance, comparison of the previous survey to <br />
								the recent survey, result of the previous survey and recent survey, lastly, the manager wants to know the factors <br />
								affecting the customer’s decision.<br />
								After downloading thde dataset, I imported it in MS Excel. Checked the data for possible errors, blank spaces,
								and duplicates. Luckily, I didn’t encounter any errors or even duplicates in this dataset.
								So, I proceed to analyze and rename some columns for better understanding. By using pivot tables,
								I easily found out the answers to what the manager needed to know. I used an interactive dashboard
								to present the data for the management.<br />
								In conclusion, the Management job has the highest balance of $18 million in total. While blue collar job and technician are
								the 2nd and 3rd highest total balance. I used a stacked bar graph to compare the previous and recent survey.
								In this graph, we can totally see that 74.26% of no are coming from the unknown result from the previous survey.
								The bank needs to make sure that all of their customers participate and answer the questions clearly.
								And lastly, house loan and personal loan are also factors affecting the customer’s decision. There is higher
								possibility that the customer disagrees to the campaign if they have existing house or personal loan.<br />

									In this project, the stakeholders want some insights and patterns in the sales volume during the 2016-2018 period. They also want to see the revenue per store, per category and per brand. Lastly, present the top sales representative.<br />
					
									The data I used on this project was from my SQL query. I imported the data to MS Excel and started checking for blank spaces and duplicates. After cleaning, I used pivot table and began to build the executive dashboard. I noticed that the year 2017 had the highest revenue with a total of $3,845,515. In the first quarter of 2018, the sales volume was so high, then it suddenly dropped below $100,000. We need to gather more data focusing on June-December 2018 because of the alarming drop of sales in that period. While the top store in terms of revenue is Baldwin Bikes with a 68% of total sales compared to Santa Cruz Bikes and Rowlett Bikes. In terms of bike categories, mountain bikes have the highest revenue, along with road bikes and cruiser bikes. The company should invest more in this category to increase sales. Lastly, the highest revenue per brand goes to Trek with a total of $5,129,382 sales. More than half of the sales or on this brand. For the last request of stakeholders, I listed the top sales representative and Marcelene Boyer came up with the highest revenue with a total of $2,938,889.
